<p>The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable. I've included it as a baseline to compare against the other versions. In my tests, with built-ins, the <code>4 * atan(1)</code> version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the <code>atan(1)</code> into a constant. With <code>-fno-builtin</code> specified, the <code>atan2(0, -1)</code> version is fastest.</p>

<p>Here's the main testing program (<code>pitimes.c</code>):</p>

<p>Apart from testing between various compiler flags (I've compared 32-bit against 64-bit too because the optimizations are different), I've also tried switching the order of the tests around. But still, the <code>atan2(0, -1)</code> version still comes out on top every time.</p>

It seems very feature-complete and nicely integrated into the Windows shell, and more importantly, it's fairly painless to teach to colleagues with little or no experience with source control.  <strong>However</strong>, since we have moved to Windows Vista 64bit, Tortoise has been very buggy and has seemed to cause lots of explorer.exe abnormalities and crashes.  This has happened both with older versions of the software and the latest version (1.5.1 build 13563).</p>

<p>I was curious if anyone has suggestions for other Subversion clients that will run on Windows (specifically Vista 64bit).  Developers here use a variety of text editors so using Visual Studio or Dreamweaver for SVN is not ideal.</p>

<p>I'm correlating the Vista/explorer problems with Tortoise because they normally occur when I'm using the functionality in Tortoise.  Sometimes bringing up the ""merge"" screen will cause the GUI to start acting very strange and eventually hang or crash.</p>

Without going into details, the attack attempts to execute SQL code by encoding the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transact-SQL"" rel=""noreferrer"">T-SQL</a> commands in an ASCII encoded BINARY string. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE%20@S%20NVARCHAR(4000);SET%20@S=CAST(0x44004500...06F007200%20AS%20NVARCHAR(4000));EXEC(@S);--
</code></pre>

<p>I was able to decode this in SQL, but I was a little wary of doing this since I didn't know exactly what was happening at the time.</p>

<p>I tried to write a simple decode tool, so I could decode this type of text without even touching <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server"" rel=""noreferrer"">SQL&nbsp; Server</a>. The main part I need to be decoded is:</p>

<pre><code>CAST(0x44004500...06F007200 AS
NVARCHAR(4000))
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried all of the following commands with no luck:</p>

<pre><code>txtDecodedText.Text =
    System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlDecode(txtURLText.Text);
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(txtURLText.Text));
</code></pre>

<p>What is the proper way to translate this encoding without using SQL Server? Is it possible? I'll take VB.NET code since I'm familiar with that too.</p>

<hr>

<p>Okay, I'm sure I'm missing something here, so here's where I'm at.</p>

<p>Since my input is a basic string, I started with just a snippet of the encoded portion - 4445434C41 (which translates to DECLA) - and the first attempt was to do this...</p>

<pre><code>txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(txtURL.Text));
</code></pre>

<p>...and all it did was return the exact same thing that I put in since it converted each character into is a byte.</p>

<p>I realized that I need to parse every two characters into a byte manually since I don't know of any methods yet that will do that, so now my little decoder looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (!boolIsDone)
{
    bytURLChar = byte.Parse(txtURLText.Text.Substring(intParseIndex, 2));
    bytURL[intURLIndex] = bytURLChar;
    intParseIndex += 2;
    intURLIndex++;

    if (txtURLText.Text.Length - intParseIndex &lt; 2)
    {
        boolIsDone = true;
    }
}

txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytURL);
</code></pre>

<p>Things look good for the first couple of pairs, but then the loop balks when it gets to the ""4C"" pair and says that the string is in the incorrect format.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, when I step through the debugger and to the GetString method on the byte array that I was able to parse up to that point, I get "",-+"" as the result.</p>

<p>How do I figure out what I'm missing - do I need to do a ""direct cast"" for each byte instead of attempting to parse it?</p>

<p>It seems people are assuming I am talking about private or protected variables/properties only.

So, I may be starting off from a false assumption from the get go. It appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don't need getters and setters, which goes against what I was taught, and what I was talking about, although maybe that needs to be discussed as well. That's probably a good topic for a different question though...</p>

<p>What would be better is if there was some tool that could connect to both SQL Server and MySQL, then do a copy. You lose views, stored procedures, trigger, etc, but it isn't hard to copy a table that only uses base types from one DB to another... is it?</p>

<p>That stipulated, what is the best way to migrate from <code>6.5</code> to <code>2005</code>?  Is there any direct path?  Most of the documentation I've found deals with upgrading <code>6.5</code> to <code>7</code>.</p>

<p>Should I forget about the native <code>SQL Server</code> upgrade utilities, script out all of the objects and data, and try to recreate from scratch?</p>

<p>I was going to attempt the upgrade this weekend, but server issues pushed it back till next.  So, any ideas would be welcomed during the course of the week.</p>

<p><em>Update.  This is how I ended up doing it:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Back up the database in question and Master on <code>6.5</code>.</li>
<li>Execute <code>SQL Server 2000</code>'s <code>instcat.sql</code> against <code>6.5</code>'s Master.  This allows <code>SQL Server 2000</code>'s OLEDB provider to connect to <code>6.5</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>SQL Server 2000</code>'s standalone <code>""Import and Export Data""</code> to create a DTS package, using <code>OLEDB</code> to connect to 6.5.  This successfully copied all <code>6.5</code>'s tables to a new <code>2005</code> database (also using <code>OLEDB</code>).</li>
<li>Use <code>6.5</code>'s Enterprise Manager to script out all of the database's indexes and triggers to a .sql file.</li>
<li>Execute that .sql file against the new copy of the database, in 2005's Management Studio.</li>
<li>Use 6.5's Enterprise Manager to script out all of the stored procedures.</li>
<li>Execute that <code>.sql</code> file against the <code>2005</code> database.  Several dozen sprocs had issues making them incompatible with <code>2005</code>.  Mainly <code>non-ANSI joins</code> and <code>quoted identifier issues</code>.</li>
<li>Corrected all of those issues and re-executed the <code>.sql</code> file.</li>
<li>Recreated the <code>6.5</code>'s logins in <code>2005</code> and gave them appropriate permissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>There was a bit of rinse/repeat when correcting the stored procedures (there were hundreds of them to correct), but the upgrade went great otherwise.</p>

<p>Being able to use Management Studio instead of <code>Query Analyzer</code> and <code>Enterprise Manager 6.5</code> is such an amazing difference.  A few report queries that took 20-30 seconds on the <code>6.5 database</code> are now running in 1-2 seconds, without any modification, new indexes, or anything.  I didn't expect that kind of immediate improvement.</p>

<p>When it comes to asynchronous programming, a C interface is not enough and we rely on COM controls to fire events to VB6.</p>

<p>My problem is that when I register the control in VB6, VB loads this control in memory and does not unload it until I quit the VB6 IDE. As the control is loaded the whole time, I am unable to recompile it in VC6, because the DLL file is locked.</p>

<p>A solution I found is not to enable the control in VB but use the <code>CreateObject()</code> with the full name of my control. The problem then is that I must declare my control as an Object because VB6 knows nothing of the interface I am using and I do not have access to IntelliSense, which is a pain.</p>

<p>Any idea how I can tell VB6 to unload controls after quitting the application or directly in the IDE ?</p>

Now, there is a development and a live one. As this should be part of a buildscript (standard windows batch, even do with current complexity of those scripts, i might switch to PowerShell or so later), Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count.</p>

<p>Would you just copy the .mdf File and attach it? I am always a bit careful when working with binary data, as this seems to be a compatiblity issue (even though development and live should run the same version of the server at all time).</p>

<p>Or - given the lack of ""EXPLAIN CREATE TABLE"" in T-SQL - do you do something that exports an existing database into SQL-Scripts which you can run on the target server? If yes, is there a tool that can automatically dump a given Database into SQL Queries and that runs off the command line? (Again, Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count).</p>

<p>And lastly - given the fact that the live database already contains data, the deployment may not involve creating all tables but rather checking the difference in structure and ALTER TABLE the live ones instead, which may also need data verification/conversion when existing fields change.</p>

<p>I've got Windows authentication mode set in the Web.config, disabled anonymous access and configured the correct default domain in IIS, but it's still asking the user to log in and, more annoyingly, the user is required to provide the domain too (<em>DOMAIN\auser</em>), which is causing problems with non-technical visitors.  Thank Zeus for password remembering functionality.</p>

<p>I'm not the network administrator so it's possible that something about Active Directory is set up incorrectly, or it could just be me missing something very simple.  Please note that I don't want to impersonate the user, I just need to know that the IPrincipal.Name property matches that of a valid record in my user database, hence authenticating the user to my application.</p>

<p>To this end, it would be very useful to have a checklist of all configuration requirements for AD, ASP.NET and IIS to work together in this manner as a reference for debugging and hopefully reducing some user friction.</p>

"1069","1","1073","","2008-08-04 07:30:01","","64","36757","<p>I'm working on a <strong>multithreaded</strong> C++ application that is corrupting the heap.  The usual tools to locate this corruption seem to be inapplicable.  Old builds (18 months old) of the source code exhibit the same behaviour as the most recent release, so this has been around for a long time and just wasn't noticed; on the downside, source deltas can't be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are <em>a lot</em> of code changes in the repository.</p>

<p>The prompt for crashing behaviuor is to generate throughput in this system - socket transfer of data which is munged into an internal representation.  I have a set of test data that will periodically cause the app to exception (various places, various causes - including heap alloc failing, thus: heap corruption).</p>

<p>The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash.  Disabling a hyper-threading core or a dual-core core reduces the rate of (but does not eliminate) corruption.  This suggests a timing related issue.</p>

<p>Now here's the rub:<br>
When it's run under a lightweight debug environment (say <code>Visual Studio 98 / AKA MSVC6</code>) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an <code>alloc;</code> when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify, <code>VS2008/MSVC9</code> or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn't crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above <code>50%</code>, disk light is not on, the program's going as fast it can, box consuming <code>1.3G</code> of 2G of RAM).  So, <strong>I've got a choice between being able to reproduce the problem (but not identify the cause) or being able to idenify the cause or a problem I can't reproduce.</strong></p>

<p>My current best guesses as to where to next is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an <code>E6550 Core2 Duo</code>); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or</li>
<li>Rewrite operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> to use <code>VirtualAlloc</code> and <code>VirtualProtect</code> to mark memory as read-only as soon as it's done with.  Run under <code>MSVC6</code> and have the OS catch the bad-guy who's writing to freed memory.  Yes, this is a sign of desperation: who the hell rewrites <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>?!  I wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under Purify et al.</li>
</ol>

<p>And, no: Shipping with Purify instrumentation built in is not an option.</p>

<p>A colleague just walked past and asked ""Stack Overflow?  Are we getting stack overflows now?!?""</p>

<p>And now, the question: <strong>How do I locate the heap corruptor?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Update: balancing <code>new[]</code> and <code>delete[]</code> seems to have gotten a long way towards solving the problem.  Instead of 15mins, the app now goes about two hours before crashing.  Not there yet.  Any further suggestions? The heap corruption persists.</p>

<p>Update: a release build under Visual Studio 2008 seems dramatically better; current suspicion rests on the <code>STL</code> implementation that ships with <code>VS98</code>.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""3"">
  <li>Reproduce the problem. <code>Dr Watson</code> will produce a dump that might be helpful in further analysis. </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I'll take a note of that, but I'm concerned that Dr Watson will only be tripped up after the fact, not when the heap is getting stomped on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another try might be using <code>WinDebug</code> as a debugging tool which is quite powerful being at the same time also lightweight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Got that going at the moment, again: not much help until something goes wrong.  I want to catch the vandal in the act.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe these tools will allow you at least to narrow the problem to certain component.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't hold much hope, but desperate times call for...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And are you sure that all the components of the project have correct runtime library settings (<code>C/C++ tab</code>, Code Generation category in VS 6.0 project settings)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No I'm not, and I'll spend a couple of hours tomorrow going through the workspace (58 projects in it) and checking they're all compiling and linking with the appropriate flags.

<p>Then, Microsoft decided that WinHelp was not hip and cool anymore and switched to CHM, up to the point they actually axed WinHelp from Vista.</p>

<p>Now, CHM maybe nice, but everyone that tried to open a .chm file on the Network will know the nice ""Navigation to the webpage was canceled"" screen that is caused by security restrictions.</p>

<p>While there are ways to make CHM work off the network, this is hardly a good choice, because when a user presses the Help Button he wants help and not have to make some funky settings.</p>

<p>Bottom Line: I find CHM absolutely unusable. But with WinHelp not being an option anymore either, I wonder what the alternatives are, especially when it comes to integrate with my Application (i.e. for WinHelp and CHM there are functions that allow you to directly jump to a topic)?</p>

<p>It's trivial to do if the search and replace strings are the same length (or the replace string is shorter than the search string), since I have enough space allocated.  If I try to use <code>realloc()</code>, I get an error that tells me I am doing a double free - which I don't see how I am, since I am only using <code>realloc()</code>.</p>

<p>Perhaps a little code will help:</p>

<pre><code>void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace) {
    int searchLen = strlen(search);
    int replaceLen = strlen(replace);
    int delta = replaceLen - searchLen;
    char *find = input;

    while (find = strstr(find, search)) {

        if (delta &gt; 0) {
            realloc(input, strlen(input) + delta);
            find = strstr(input, search);            
        }

        memmove(find + replaceLen, find + searchLen, strlen(input) - (find - input));
        memmove(find, replace, replaceLen);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The program works, until I try to <code>realloc()</code> in an instance where the replaced string will be longer than the initial string.  (It still kind of works, it just spits out errors as well as the result).</p>

<p>If it helps, the calling code looks like:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace);

int main(void) {
    char *input = malloc(81);

    while ((fgets(input, 81, stdin)) != NULL) {
        strrep(input, ""Noel"", ""Christmas"");
    }
}

<p>A dict of dicts is more flexible and simpler to implement, but I intuitively expect a list of lists to be faster. The list option would also require that I keep the data separate from the structure, while dicts would allow for something of the sort:</p>

<p>Yes, I should have been a bit clearer on what I mean by efficiency. In this particular case I mean it in terms of random access retrieval.</p>

<p>Loading the data in to memory isn't a huge problem. That's done once and for all. The time consuming part is visiting the nodes so I can extract the information and measure the metrics I'm interested in.</p>

<p>I hadn't considered making each node a class (properties are the same for all nodes) but it seems like that would add an extra layer of overhead?

<p>In other words, given a bunch of distinct colors, come up with an ordering so I can use as many colors as I need starting at the beginning and be reasonably assured that they are all distinct and that nearby colors are also very distinct (e.g., bluish red isn't next to reddish blue).</p>

<p>Anyway, here's the problem:</p>

<p>Let's say you have some class which wraps or includes networked file IO operations (e.g. reading and writing to some file at some particular UNC path somewhere). For various reasons you don't want those IO operations to fail, so if you detect that they fail you retry them and you keep retrying them until they succeed or you reach a timeout. I already have a convenient RetryTimer class which I can instantiate and use to sleep the current thread between retries and determine when the timeout period has elapsed, etc.</p>

<p>The problem is that you have a bunch of IO operations in several methods of this class, and you need to wrap each of them in try-catch / retry logic.</p>

<p>Here's an example code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>RetryTimer fileIORetryTimer = new RetryTimer(TimeSpan.FromHours(10));
bool success = false;
while (!success)
{
    try
    {
        // do some file IO which may succeed or fail
        success = true;
    }
    catch (IOException e)
    {
        if (fileIORetryTimer.HasExceededRetryTimeout)
        {
            throw e;
        }
        fileIORetryTimer.SleepUntilNextRetry();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, how do you avoid duplicating most of this code for every file IO operation throughout the class? My solution was to use anonymous delegate blocks and a single method in the class which executed the delegate block passed to it. This allowed me to do things like this in other methods:</p>

<pre><code>this.RetryFileIO( delegate()
    {
        // some code block
    } );
</code></pre>

<p>I like this somewhat, but it leaves a lot to be desired. I'd like to hear how other people would solve this sort of problem.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/m0swl.png"" alt=""[Part of the SPSS output""></p>

<p>They're really only concerned about the <code>F</code> and <code>Sig.</code> values. My problem is that I have no background in statistics, and I can't figure out what the tests are called, or how to calculate them.</p>

<p>How do you decide what should be kept in the built-in user Profile, or if you should create your own database table and add a column for the desired fields? For example, a user has a zip code, should I save the zip code in my own table, or should I add it to the web.config xml profile and access it via the user profile ASP.NET mechanism? </p>

<p>The pros/cons I can think of right now are that since I don't know the profile very well (it is a bit of a <em>Matrix</em> right now), I probably can do whatever I want if I go the table route (e.g., SQL to get all the users in the same zip code as the current user). I don't know if I can do the same if I use the ASP.NET profile.</p>

<p>The document type (7 possible document types: <em>Invoice</em>, <em>Contract</em> etc.) is passed as a parameter to the web service's <em>UploadDocument</em> method. The question is, what should the type (and possible values) of this parameter be?</p>

<p>Since you need to hardcode these values in both applications, I think it is O.K. to use a descriptive string (<em>Invoice</em>, <em>Contract</em>, <em>WorkOrder</em>, <em>SignedWorkOrder</em>). </p>

<p>Is it maybe a better approach to create a <em>DocumentTypes</em> enumeration in the first application, and to reproduce it also in the second application, and then pass the corresponding integer value to the web service between them?</p>

<p>You can't assume North is up: all you have is the existing lat/long->x/y mappings.</p>

<p>EDIT: it's not a Mercator projection, or anything like that. It's arbitrarily distorted for readability (think subway map). I want to use only the nearest 5 to 10 mappings so that distortion on other parts of the map doesn't affect the mapping I'm trying to compute.</p>

<p>Further, the entire map is in a very small geographical area so there's no need to worry about the globe--flat-earth assumptions are good enough.</p>

From the UI perspective, the DataContext is a design of the sections of your database that you would like to expose to through LinqToSql and is integral in setting up the ORM features of LinqToSql.</p>

<p>My question is: I am setting up a project that uses a large database where all tables are interconnected in some way through Foreign Keys. My first inclination is to make one huge DataContext class that models the entire database. That way I could in theory (though I don't know if this would be needed in practice) use the Foreign Key connections that are generated through LinqToSql to easily go between related objects in my code, insert related objects, etc.</p>

<p>However, after giving it some thought, I am now thinking that it may make more sense to create multiple DataContext classes, each one relating to a specific namespace or logical interrelated section within my database. My main concern is that instantiating and disposing one huge DataContext class all the time for individual operations that relate to specific areas of the Database would be impose an unnecessary imposition on application resources. Additionally, it is easier to create and manage smaller DataContext files than one big one. The thing that I would lose is that there would be some distant sections of the database that would not be navigable through LinqToSql (even though a chain of relationships connects them in the actual database). Additionally, there would be some table classes that would exist in more than one DataContext.</p>

<p>Any thoughts or experience on whether multiple DataContexts (corresponding to DB namespaces) are appropriate in place of (or in addition to) one very large DataContext class (corresponding to the whole DB)?</p>

"2328","1","4910","","2008-08-05 13:52:12","","13","2976","<p>I have a problem with maintaining state in an ASP.NET AJAX page. Short version: I need some way to update the page ViewState after an async callback has been made, to reflect any state changes the server made during the async call. </p>

<p>This seems to be a common problem, but I will describe my scenario to help explain:</p>

<p>I have a grid-like control which has some JavaScript enhancements - namely, the ability to drag and drop columns and rows. When a column or row is dropped into a new position, an AJAX method is invoked to notify the control server-side and fire a corresponding server-side event (""OnColumnMoved"" or ""OnRowMoved"").</p>

<p>ASP.NET AJAX calls, by default, send the entire page as the request. That way the page goes through a complete lifecycle, viewstate is persisted and the state of the control is restored before the RaiseCallbackEvent method is invoked.</p>

<p>However, since the AJAX call does not update the page, the ViewState reflects the <em>original</em> state of the control, even after the column or row has been moved. So the second time a client-side action occurs, the AJAX request goes to the server and the page &amp; control are built back up again to reflect the <em>first</em> state of the control, not the state after the first column or row was moved.</p>

<p>This problem extends to many implications. For example if we have a client-side/AJAX action to add a new item to the grid, and then a row is dragged, the grid is built server-side with one less item than on the client-side.</p>

<p>And finally &amp; most seriously for my specific example, the actual data source object we are acting upon is stored in the page ViewState. That was a design decision to allow keeping a stateful copy of the manipulated data which can either be committed to DB after many manipulations or discarded if the user backs out. That is very difficult to change.</p>

<p>So, again, I need a way for the page ViewState to be updated on callback after the AJAX method is fired.</p>

I'm able to read the data ""chunk by chunk"", i.e. getting the first 40 bytes of data converting it to a string, get the next 40 bytes.</p>

<p>Since there are at least three slightly different version of the data, I would like to read the data directly into a struct. It just feels so much more right than by reading it ""line by line"".</p>

<p><strong>I have tried the following approach but to no avail:</strong></p>

<pre><code>StructType aStruct;
int count = Marshal.SizeOf(typeof(StructType));
byte[] readBuffer = new byte[count];
BinaryReader reader = new BinaryReader(stream);
readBuffer = reader.ReadBytes(count);
GCHandle handle = GCHandle.Alloc(readBuffer, GCHandleType.Pinned);
aStruct = (StructType) Marshal.PtrToStructure(handle.AddrOfPinnedObject(), typeof(StructType));
handle.Free();
</code></pre>

<p>The stream is an opened FileStream from which I have began to read from. I get an <code>AccessViolationExceptio</code>n when using <code>Marshal.PtrToStructure</code>.</p>

<p>The stream contains more information than I'm trying to read since I'm not interested in data at the end of the file.</p>

struct StructType
{

<p>I understand that in .NET it is essential to dispose of any instances of objects that implement the <code>IDisposable</code> interface to release some resources although the object can still be something after it is disposed (hence the <code>isDisposed</code> property in forms), so I assume it can still reside in memory or at least in part?</p>

<p>I also know that when an object goes out of scope it is then marked for collection ready for the next pass of the garbage collector (although this may take time).</p>

<p>So with this in mind will setting it to <code>null</code> speed up the system releasing the memory as it does not have to work out that it is no longer in scope and are they any bad side effects?</p>

see the harm. However I have come across a mixture of opinions so any comments are useful.</p>

<p>I would like to have a main processing thread (non GUI), and be able to spin off GUIs in their own background threads as needed, and having my main non GUI thread keep working. Put another way, I want my main non GUI-thread to be the owner of the GUI-thread and not vice versa. I'm not sure this is even possible with Windows Forms(?)</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I have a component based system in which a controller dynamically load assemblies and instantiates and run classes implementing a common <code>IComponent</code> interface with a single method <code>DoStuff()</code>.</p>

<p>Which components that gets loaded is configured via a xml configuration file and by adding new assemblies containing different implementations of <code>IComponent</code>. The components provides utility functions to the main application. While the main program is doing it's thing, e.g. controlling a nuclear plant, the components might be performing utility tasks (in their own threads), e.g. cleaning the database, sending emails, printing funny jokes on the printer, what have you. What I would like, is to have one of these components be able to display a GUI, e.g. with status information for the said email sending component.</p>

<p>The lifetime of the complete system looks like this</p>

<ol>
<li>Application starts.</li>
<li>Check configuration file for components to load. Load them.</li>
<li><strong>For each component, run <code>DoStuff()</code> to initialize it and make it live its own life in their own threads.</strong></li>
<li>Continue to do main application-thingy king of work, forever.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have not yet been able to successfully perform point 3 if the component fires up a GUI in <code>DoStuff()</code>. It simply just halts until the GUI is closed. And not until the GUI is closed does the program progress to point 4.</p>

<p>It would be great if these components were allowed to start up their own Windows Forms GUIs.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>When a component tries to fire up a GUI in <code>DoStuff()</code> (the exact line of code is when the component runs <code>Application.Run(theForm)</code>), the component and hence our system ""hangs"" at the <code>Application.Run()</code> line until the GUI is closed. Well, the just fired up GUI works fine, as expected.</p>

<p>Example of components. One hasn't nothing to do with GUI, whilst the second fires up a cute windows with pink fluffy bunnies in them.</p>

<pre><code>public class MyComponent1: IComponent
{
    public string DoStuff(...) { // write something to the database  }
}

public class MyComponent2: IComponent
{
    public void DoStuff()
    {
        Application.EnableVisualStyles();
        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
        Application.Run(new Form());

        // I want the thread to immediately return after the GUI 
        // is fired up, so that my main thread can continue to work.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried this with no luck. Even when I try to fire up the GUI in it's own thread, the execution halts until the GUI as closed.</p>

<pre><code>public void DoStuff()
{
    new Thread(ThreadedInitialize).Start()
}

private void ThreadedInitialize()
{
    Application.EnableVisualStyles();
    Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
    Application.Run(new Form());
}

<p>Is it possible to spin off a GUI and return after <code>Application.Run()</code>?</p>

I am migrating to <em>JXTA</em> 2.5 and in the process I am trying to clean up a lot of my use of <em>JXTA</em>. For the most part, I approached <em>JXTA</em> with a <strong>just make it work</strong> attitude. I used it to jumpstart creating and managing my peer-to-peer overlay network and providing basic communication services. I would like to use it in a more <em>JXTA</em> way since I am making changes to move to 2.5 anyway.</p>

<p>My first step would be a basic creation of a custom <code>PeerGroup</code>. I see some new new mechanisms that are using the <code>META-INF.services</code> infrastructure of Java. Should I be listing a related <code>PeerGroup</code> implementing object here with a <em>GUID</em> in <code>net.jxta.platform.Module</code>? As I understand it, if I do this, when a group with a spec ID matching the <em>GUID</em> is encountered and joined or created it should automatically use the matching object. I should be able to just manually tie a <code>PeerGroup</code> object to the group but this new method using <code>META-INF</code> seems to be a lot easier to manage.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any pointers or examples of using this infrastructure for <code>PeerGroup</code> implementation? Also, some general information on the <code>META-INF.services</code> mechanism in Java would be helpful.</p>

<p>I popped his site open and viewed the source, and there was a line of Javascript includes at the bottom of the source right before the closing HTML tag. They included this file (among many others): <a href=""http://www.98hs.ru/js.js"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.98hs.ru/js.js</a> &lt;-- <strong>TURN OFF JAVASCRIPT BEFORE YOU GO TO THAT URL.</strong></p>

<p>So I commented it out for now. It turns out his FTP password was a plain dictionary word six letters long, so we think that's how it got hacked. We've changed his password to an 8+ digit non-word string (he wouldn't go for a passphrase since he is a hunt-n-peck typer).</p>

<p>I did a <a href=""http://whois.domaintools.com/98hs.ru"" rel=""noreferrer"">whois on 98hs.ru</a> and found it is hosted from a server in Chile. There is actually an e-mail address associated with it too, but I seriously doubt this person is the culprit. Probably just some other site that got hacked...</p>

<p>I have no idea what to do at this point though as I've never dealt with this sort of thing before. Anyone have any suggestions?</p>

<p>He was using plain jane un-secured ftp through webhost4life.com. I don't even see a way to <em>do</em> sftp on their site. I'm thinking his username and password got intercepted?</p>

<p>This works well if the highest value is the peak we are looking for but if the device is not working correctly we can see a second peak which can be higher than the initial peak. We take 10 readings a second from 16 devices over a 90 second period.</p>

<p>My initial thoughts are to cycle through the readings checking to see if the previous and next points are less than the current to find a peak and construct an array of peaks. Maybe we should be looking at a average of a number of points either side of the current position to allow for noise in the system.

<ul>
<li>Data is retrieved from external webservices</li>
<li>Data is stored in SQL 2005</li>
<li>Data is manipulated via a web GUI</li>
<li>The windows service that communicates with the web services has no coupling with our internal web UI, except via the database.</li>
<li>Communication with the web services needs to be both time-based, and triggered via user intervention on the web UI.</li>
</ul>

<p>The current (pre-pre-production) model for web service communication triggering is via a database table that stores trigger requests generated from the manual intervention.  I do not really want to have multiple trigger mechanisms, but would like to be able to populate the database table with triggers based upon the time of the call.  As I see it there are two ways to accomplish this.</p>

<p>1) Adapt the trigger table to store two extra parameters.  One being ""Is this time-based or manually added?"" and a nullable field to store the timing details (exact format to be determined).  If it is a manaully created trigger, mark it as processed when the trigger has been fired, but not if it is a timed trigger.<br>
<em>or</em><br>
2) Create a second windows service that creates the triggers on-the-fly at timed intervals.</p>

<p>The second option seems like a fudge to me, but the management of option 1 could easily turn into a programming nightmare (how do you know if the last poll of the table returned the event that needs to fire, and how do you then stop it re-triggering on the next poll)</p>

<p>I'd appreciate it if anyone could spare a few minutes to help me decide which route (one of these two, or possibly a third, unlisted one) to take.</p>

<p>I expected to forbid access to users that didn't navigate the site but issue direct GET requests to the ""servlet1"" or ""servlet2"" servlets using querystrings. But my expectations ended abruptly because the regular expression <code>(servlet1|servlet2)/.+\?.+</code> didn't worked at all. </p>

<p>I was really disappointed when I changed that expression to <code>(servlet1|servlet2)/.+</code> and it worked so well that my users were blocked no matter if they navigated the site or not. </p>

<p>So, my question is: How do I can accomplish this thing of not allowing ""robots"" with direct access to certain pages if I have no access/privileges/time to modify the application?</p>

what my options are.</p>

<p>Downsides to ClickOnce:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consists of multiple files - Seems easier to distribute one file than manageing a bunch of file and the downloader to download those files.</li>
<li>You have to build it again for CD installations (for when the end user dosn't have internet)</li>
<li>Program does not end up in Program Files - It ends up hidden away in some application catch folder, making it much harder to shortcut to.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pros to ClickOnce:</p>

<ul>
<li>It works. Magically. And it's built
into VisualStudio 2008 express.</li>
<li>Makes it easy to upgrade the
application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does Windows Installer do these things as well? I know it dosen't have any of the ClickOnce cons, but It would be nice to know if it also has the ClickOnce pros.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:
I ended up using Wix 2 (Wix 3 was available but at the time I did the project, no one had a competent tutorial). It was nice because it supported the three things I (eventually) needed. An optional start-up-with-windows shortcut, a start-up-when-the-installer-is-done option, and three paragraphs of text that my boss thinks will keep uses from clicking the wrong option.</p>

The function of the application is simply a pass-through for data from a serial device to a file. It performs many, many transformations on the data before writing it to the file, so the GUI for the application is simply all the settings that dictate what those transformations should be.</p>

<p>What's the best way to go about designing/coding a tree-view preferences dialog? The way I've been going about it is building the main window with a docked tree control on the left. Then I have been creating container controls that correspond to each node of the tree. When a node is selected, the app brings that node's corresponding container control to the front, moves it to the right position, and maximizes it in the main window. This seems really, really clunky while designing it. It basically means I have tons of container controls beyond the edge of the main window during design time that I have to keep scrolling the main window over to in order to work with them. I don't know if this totally makes sense the way I'm writing this, but maybe this visual for what I'm talking about will make more sense:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bVRJB.png"" alt=""form design""></p>

<p>Basically I have to work with this huge form, with container controls all over the place, and then do a bunch of run-time reformatting to make it all work. This seems like a <em>lot</em> of extra work. Am I doing this in a totally stupid way? Is there some ""obvious"" easier way of doing this that I'm missing?</p>

<p>I can get the windows privileges by simply configuring the timer service to use an account which is a member of local administrators. I understand that this is not a good solution since it gives SharePoint timer service more rights then it is supposed to have. But it at least allows my SharePoint timer job to run <code>stsadm</code>.</p>

<p>Another problem with running the timer service under local administrator is that this user won't necessarily have <code>SHAREPOINT\System</code> SharePoint privileges which I also need for this SharePoint job. It turns out that <code>SPSecurity.RunWithElevatedPrivileges</code> won't work in this case. Reflector shows that <code>RunWithElevatedPrivileges</code> checks if the current process is <code>owstimer</code> (the service process which runs SharePoint jobs) and performs no elevation this is the case (the rational here, I guess, is that the timer service is supposed to run under <code>NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService</code> windows account which which has <code>SHAREPOINT\System</code> SharePoint privileges, and thus there's no need to elevate privileges for a timer job).</p>

<p>The only possible solution here seems to be to run the timer service under its usual NetworkService windows account and to run stsadm as a local administrator by storing the administrator credentials somewhere and passing them to System.Diagnostics.Process.Run() trough the StarInfo's Username, domain and password.</p>

<p>It seems everything should work now, but here is another problem I'm stuck with at the moment. Stsamd is failing with the following error popup (!) (Winternals filemon shows that stsadm is running under the administrator in this case):</p>

<p><code>The application failed to initialize properly (0x0c0000142).</code> <br />
<code>Click OK to terminate the application.</code></p>

<p>Event Viewer registers nothing except the popup.</p>

<p>The local administrator user is my account and when I just run <code>stsadm</code> interactively under this account everything is ok. It also works fine when I configure the timer service to run under this account.</p>

<p>I want to be able to replicate data on both servers continuously, but have run into several roadblocks. One of them being, under MySQL master/slave configurations, every now and then, some statements drop (!), meaning; some people logging on to the mirror URL don't see data that I know is on the main server and vice versa. Let's say this happens on a meaningful block of data once every month, so I can live with it and assume it's a ""lost packet"" issue (i.e., god knows, but we'll compensate).</p>

<p>The other most important (and annoying) recurring issue is that, when for some reason we do a major upload or update (or reboot) on one end and have to <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sever"" rel=""noreferrer"">sever</a> the link, then LOAD DATA FROM MASTER doesn't work and I have to manually dump on one end and upload on the other, quite a task nowadays moving some .5 TB worth of data.</p>

I am using the .net <code>HttpListener</code> class, but I won't be running this application on IIS and am not using ASP.net.  This <a href=""http://www.leastprivilege.com/CommentView.aspx?guid=0c34094a-bdd4-4041-be6e-919f10fe1d31"" rel=""noreferrer"">web site</a> describes what code to actually use to implement SSL with asp.net and <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/adarshk/archive/2004/11/10/255467.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">this site</a> describes how to set up the certificates (although I'm not sure if it works only for IIS or not).  </p>

<p>The class documentation describes various types of authentication (basic, digest, Windows, etc.) --- none of them refer to SSL.  It does say that if <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httplistener.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">HTTPS is used, you will need to set a server certificate</a>.  Is this going to be a one line property setting and <code>HttpListener</code> figures out the rest?  </p>

<p>In short, I need to know how to set up the certificates and how to modify the code to implement SSL.</p>

<p>Although it doesn't occur when I'm trying to access HTTPS, I did notice an error in my System Event log - the source is ""Schannel"" and the content of the message is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A fatal error occurred when attempting
  to access the SSL server credential
  private key. The error code returned
  from the cryptographic module is
  0x80090016.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit:<br>
<strong>Steps taken so far</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Created a working HTTPListener in C# that works for HTTP connections (e.g. ""<a href=""http://localhost:8089/foldername/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://localhost:8089/foldername/</a>""</li>
<li>Created a certificate using makecert.exe</li>
<li>Added the certificate to be trusted using certmgr.exe</li>
<li>Used Httpcfg.exe to listen for SSL connections on a test port (e.g. 8090)</li>
<li>Added port 8080 to the HTTPListener via listener.Prefixes.Add(<a href=""https://localhost:8090/foldername/"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://localhost:8090/foldername/</a>"");</li>
<li>tested an HTTP client connection, e.g. (<a href=""http://localhost:8089/foldername/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://localhost:8089/foldername/</a>"") in a browser and receive correct return</li>
<li>tested an HTTPS client connection, e.g. (<a href=""http://localhost:8090/foldername/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://localhost:8090/foldername/</a>"") in a browser and receive ""Data Transfer Interrupted"" (in Firefox)</li>
<li>debugging in visual studio shows that the listener callback that receives the requests never gets hit when the HTTPS connection starts - I don't see any place that I could set a breakpoint to catch anything else earlier.</li>
<li>netstat shows that listening ports are open for both HTTPS and HTTP.  the HTTPS port does go to TIME_WAIT after a connection is attempted.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Fiddler</a> and <a href=""http://www.ieinspector.com/httpanalyzer/"" rel=""noreferrer"">HTTPAnalyzer</a> don't catch any of the traffic, I guess it doesn't get far enough in the process to show up in those HTTP analysis tools</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>What could the problem be? </li>
<li>Is there a piece of .Net code I am missing (meaning I have to do more in C# other than simply add a prefix to the listener that points to HTTPS, which is what i have done)</li>
<li>Have a missed a configuration step somewhere? </li>
<li>What else might I do to analyze the problem?</li>
<li>Is the error message in the System Event log a sign of the problem?  If so how would it be fixed?</li>

Rather than just merging my <code>ChangeLog</code> changes, it actually pulled mine plus some previous ones that were not in the destination <code>ChangeLog</code>.  I noticed there was a conflict when I executed --dry-run, so I updated <code>ChangeLog</code>, and there was still a conflict (and I saw the conflict when I did the actual merge).</p>

<p>I then later diffed on the file I was merging from:</p>

<p>So, I have 2 files changed, only ChangeLog is relevant, the other merged fine.  When I go to my regular trunk checkout, I do the diff command above and see:</p>

As the user changes settings using the app's UI (clicking checkboxes, choosing radio buttons, etc.), I plan to be writing those changes out to the <code>AppSettings</code>. At the same time, while the program is running I plan to be accessing the <code>AppSettings</code> constantly from a process that will be constantly processing data. Changes to settings via the UI need to affect the data processing in real-time, which is why the process will be accessing the <code>AppSettings</code> constantly.</p>

<p>Is this a good idea with regard to performance? Using <code>AppSettings</code> is supposed to be ""the right way"" to store and access configuration settings when writing .Net apps, but I worry that this method wasn't intended for a constant load (at least in terms of settings being constantly read).</p>

<p>If anyone has experience with this, I would greatly appreciate the input.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I should probably clarify a few points.</p>

<p>This is not a web application, so connecting a database to the application might be overkill simply for storing configuration settings. This is a Windows Forms application.</p>

<p>According to the MSDN documention, the <code>ConfigurationManager</code> is for storing not just application level settings, but user settings as well. (Especially important if, for instance, the application is installed as a partial-trust application.)</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I accepted lomaxx's answer because <code>Properties</code> does indeed look like a good solution, without having to add any additional layers to my application (such as a database). When using Properties, it already does all the caching that others suggested. This means any changes and subsequent reads are all done in memory, making it extremely fast. Properties only writes the changes to disk when you explicitly tell it to. This means I can make changes to the config settings on-the-fly at run time and then only do a final save out to disk when the program exits.</p>

<p>Just to verify it would actually be able to handle the load I need, I did some testing on my laptop and was able to do 750,000 reads and 7,500 writes per second using Properties. That is so far above and beyond what my application will <em>ever</em> even come close to needing that I feel quite safe in using Properties without impacting performance.</p>

<p>This works great.</p>

<p>I then wanted to create a bookmarklet in my firefox. I googled and found bits and pieces and ended up with:</p>

<pre><code>javascript:void(
    open('https://seconduser:password@api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/add?url='

          'delicious','toolbar=no,width=500,height=250'
        )
    );
</code></pre>

<p>But all that happens is that I get this from del.icio.us:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" standalone=""yes""?&gt;
&lt;result code=""access denied"" /&gt;
&lt;!-- fe04.api.del.ac4.yahoo.net uncompressed/chunked Thu Aug  7 02:02:54 PDT 2008 --&gt;

<p>If I then go to the address bar and press enter, it changes to:</p>

<p>I would like to be able to drag, say, a tree node from a treeview in my winforms app into a specific location in the hosted web page and have it trigger a javascript event there.
Currently, I can implement the <code>IDocHostUIHandler</code> interface and getting drag\drop events on the browser control, then call <code>Navigate(""javascript:fire_event(...)"")</code> on the control to execute a script on the page. However, I want this to work only when I drop data on a <em>specific</em> part of the page.</p>

<p>One solution, I suppose, would be to bite the bullet and write a custom browser plugin in the form of an activex control, embed that in the location I want to drop to and let that implement the needed drag\drop interfaces.</p>

<p>Also, for some reason, when I create/edit my posts in IE7, the code shows up correctly in the preview view, but when I actually post the message, the formatting gets removed.  Editing my post in Firefox 2 seems to have worked, FWIW.</p>

<p>Another edit: Yeah, I unaccepted GateKiller's answer.  It does indeed work nicely on my simple page, but not in my actual heavier page.  I'll investigate some of the links y'all have pointed me to.</p>

<p>My current thinking:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Break script into parts (possibly in separate scripts):</p>

<ol>
<li>table creation</li>
<li>add indexes</li>
<li>add triggers</li>
<li>add constraints</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Each script would get called by the master script.</p></li>
<li>I might need a script to drop constraints temporarily for testing</li>
<li>There may be orphaned tables in the schema, I plan to identify suspect tables.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any other advice?</p>

<p>Edit: Also if anyone knows good tools to automate part of the process, we're using MS SQL 2000 (old, I know).</p>
